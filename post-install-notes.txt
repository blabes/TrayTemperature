Installation Note for Windows 10 Users
--------------------------------------

Please note that in Windows 10, the temperature icon may not be visible
by default after installation. Many icons are hidden in an expandable
pane, giving you more space on your taskbar. To reveal them, click on the
upward facing arrow to the left of the Notification area.

The most straightforward way to permanently show any of these icons in your
Notification area is to drag them with the cursor from the expandable pane
to the taskbar.
