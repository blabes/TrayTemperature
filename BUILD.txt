Some build notes for TrayTemperature
====================================

To prepare for running inno setup compiler:

32-bit:
-------
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_32\bin
CD build-TrayTemperature-Desktop_Qt_5_12_5_MinGW_32_bit-Release\release
C:\Qt\5.12.5\mingw73_32\bin\windeployqt.exe TrayTemperature.exe

64-bit:
-------
PATH=%PATH%;C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_64\bin
CD build-TrayTemperature-Desktop_Qt_5_12_5_MinGW_64_bit-Release\release
C:\Qt\5.12.5\mingw73_64\bin\windeployqt.exe TrayTemperature.exe

Then run inno to create the two installer executables

To create a new release:
------------------------

Make a git tag 3 levels deep, like 1.1.1 so it gets grabbed correctly by gitversion.pri
and placed in the VERSION and GIT_VERSION variables. (Tools/Git/Git Tools/Gitk)

In Qt Creator for both 32 and 64-bit Release:
 - Build/Clean Project
 - Build/Run qmake
 - Build/Run; check the TrayTemperature version in Help/About

Run w32 and w64 iss files in Inno Setup Compiler (right-click, Open With, System Editor)
 - Build/Compile
 - Run installer
 - Run TrayTemperature and check its version in Help/About

To push just a tag: git push <repo-name> <tag-name>
                ex: git push origin 1.2.0
